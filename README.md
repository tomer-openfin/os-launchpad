# OpenFin OS

OpenFin OS centralizes app discovery and can be customized with your own branding.

**Features**

- Customizable look and feel
- Supports custom application manifests from local and remote environments
- Searchable application directory

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository

Now set your `node` version. The version we're standardizing is in the `.nvmrc` file. If you're using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (which we recommenend that you do), you can simply `cd` into this directory and type `nvm use`. After that, continue with the next steps:

2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
4. In a separate console tab, `npm run openfin`

## Development

### Project Structure/Architecture

Project structure follows a more modular "pod" style file directory system following mostly a functional approach. The following are the main libraries used which all have a specific use case.

`react` - used mostly as view library. Local component state is used sparingly.

`redux`/`react-redux` - data layer and global store across the application. Some business logic can be organized here through `connect`/`containers`. Redux actions follow the [flux standard action (FSA) object structure](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action). Where async action's types follow a `_REQUEST`, `_SUCCESS`, and `_FAILURE` flow.

`redux-saga` - business logic layer. A middleware that handles async side effects based off of redux actions.

`styled-components` - chosen styling library. It works well with the project structure and the modular components.

`storybook` - development tool to easily build components in isolation.

This Application can be viewed as a completely known machine where actions come from the user, fin, and the backend. These async events are passed to our sagas to handle what should be the logic/flow and outcome of these events.

#### /assets

Assets are imported and used inside components. Assets will be hashed and fingerprinted on build.

#### /components

Components modularly organized and split into 3 categories. UI, Components, and Admin Components.

`UI` - components should be very simple and shared across multiple components. Probably best if UI components are not composed of anything but itself. If it composes other UI components, then maybe it belongs in the `Components` category. UI components should not contain a `Container` file.

`Components` - Composed of multiple components and shared across all states of the application (admin vs non-admin users).

`Admin Components` - Components that will only appear for admin users.

Component directories follow the following structure:

- Component.css.ts
- Component.story.tsx
- Component.tsx
- ComponentContainer.ts
- index.ts
- utils.ts(x)

#### /config

os-launchpad's window configurations for all of its application windows.

#### /hocs

Higher order components which share specific functionality related to multiple components.

#### /layoutsService

Should be treated as if it were its own repository. Idea being that this may be moved to the layoutsService itself, but for now lives in os-launchpad. Most of the logic was actually taken from the demos directory of openfin-layouts.

#### /redux

Redux slices of state and where each slice is split into its own directory. These directories follow the following structure:

- actions.ts - contains both action types and action creators
- index.ts - exports all modules within its directory where reducer is the default export
- reducer.ts - redux reducer
- saga.ts - saga pertaining to only the actions within its slice of state
- selectors.ts - helper functions to retrieved data from this slice of state
- types.ts

#### /samples

Sample data used in tests and storybook.

#### /services

Services which touch outside dependencies. ApiService is the layer in which we communicate to either the backend for enterprise or localstorage for non-enterprise.

#### /styles

Housing for os-launchpad's style guide/system.

#### /types

Accumulation of types throughout the project.

#### /utils

Toolbox of various helper functions.

### Remote debugging

#### React

Run `npm run react-devtools`. This will pop up a new window, and that window will attach to the last OpenFin window that takes focus.

#### Redux

Open `http://remotedev.io/local/` in a browser. The application publishes Redux actions to the remote dev tools by default in development. There are other ways to remotely debug, you can find more information in the [Monitoring](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools#monitoring) section of the `remote-redux-devtools` repo.

On a Windows virtual machine, open `http://<vmnet1 address here>:8000/` in a browser to view the remote Redux Devtools.

### Developing in Storybook

Components can be developed in Storybook without launching Openfin (`npm run storybook`). Developing components in isolation is good practice and may help build less coupled components.

### Developing on macOS

This is the preferred development environment; however, as of right now you won't be able to launch applications because there is no RVM in the macOS runtime of OpenFin. If you need to test this behavior, you can run the application in Windows inside a virtual machine. Details below.

### Running the app in a virtual machine

If you want to run the application in Windows inside of a virtual machine, you'll need to set a few environment variables.

First, get the IP address of your virtual machine. You can do this by running `ifconfig` to see all network interfaces, or run:

`ifconfig | grep vmnet1 -A 2 | grep inet | awk '{print $2}'`

Then, create a `.env` file (check the `.env.sample` file for details) and fill in the following variables:

```
HOST=<vmnet1 address here>
PORT=8080
```

Start the application on your host machine, and start OpenFin in your guest machine. The application manifest will be available at `http://<vmnet1 address here>:8080/api/launcher.json`

Should you ever need to kill all openfin processes on your VM, you can run the following command on powershell or the terminal: `taskkill /F /IM openfin.exe /T`

#### Installing Openfin on the VM

1. Download the Openfin from the following link, filling in App Name and Deploy Location: `https://install.openfin.co/download?fileName=<APP_NAME_HERE>&config=<DEPLOY_LOCATION>`. E.g., `https://install.openfin.co/download?fileName=Whiteboard&config=http://172.16.28.1:8080`
2. Run the app.
3. After installation, edit the app's desktop shortcut. In the Target field, edit the --config option to point to your DEPLOY_LOCATION, e.g., " --config="http://172.16.28.1:8080/app.json".
4. Launch the app.

### Build

When the build script is run, a build artifact is created in the `build` directory.

### GitHub Practices

New pull requests should request to be merged into the `develop` branch, and commits should be squashed when merging.
There are tsconfig changes to map all calls to styled-components to our typed version inside src/styles/styled-components.ts.

### Using VS Code

Due to the baseUrl addition in tsconfig, imports in typescript files will be absolute from the baseUrl. To keep everything relative, update editor configs to always choose relative pathing for smart imports.

vscode:
"typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative",
